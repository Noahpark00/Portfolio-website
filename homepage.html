            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Noah, I am a 24 year old Computer science student from Georgia 
                studying at Franciscan University. I have a wife, Mary, and two daughters,
                 Daisy and Charlotte. I was initially going to a local college in Georgia in 2018
                 until I decided to leave and become a missionary serving teens at a camp in north
                  Georgia. I was a missionary for two years and that is where I met my wife. After 
                  being a missionary I moved to Atlanta to be a youth minister and to get married.
                  During this time I felt the Lord call me to finish my degree and led my family
                  to Steubenville. While here, the Lord has blessed my wife with a job as a 
                  resident director on campus and has helped me to grow tremendously in school,
                  and given us two beautiful daughters.
